<img src="image1.PNG" alt="ERRO">


<h2>This game was developed in java.</h2>

---
This game consists of not letting the ball go out of the corner where
you are positioned, this is the first version of the game, so all 
suggestions are welcome.

In the game game i also had to use artificial intelligence on the enemy
part, since the game is 1 vs Machine.

Good luck :)

Note: In the AI part was not used any kind of frameworks.
